    "In this homework, you will leverage all of the components built in the last three homeworks to solve some modern problems with high performing network structures. We will start by adding a few new ops leveraging our new CPU/CUDA backends. Then, you will implement convolution, and a convolutional neural network to train a classifier on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset. Finally, you will implement recurrent and long-short term memory (LSTM) neural networks, and do word-level prediction language modeling on the *Penn Treebank* dataset.\n",
